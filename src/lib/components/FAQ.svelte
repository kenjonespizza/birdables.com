						How do Birdables help birds?

							Great question! <strong>We donate a portion of profits</strong> to a bird conservation
							organization like the <ExternalLink href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/"
								>Cornell Lab of Ornithology</ExternalLink
							>, <ExternalLink href="https://ebird.org/">eBird</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink
								href="https://www.audubon.org/">Audubon</ExternalLink
							>, etc. More details on this are still to come, as it is still unclear the cost of
							running this operation. All donation amounts & recipients will be available on this
							website in the future.
						</p>
						<!-- ToDo: link page -->

						<p>
							To make sure Birdables is not contributing to the destruction of bird habitats, <strong
								>100% recycled paper</strong
							> is used for all physical cards and envelope mailers. No trees are cut down for the creation
							of the cards.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Birdables NFT's (digital cards) are minted and distributed on the Polygon
							blockchain, which validates transactions using the Proof-of-Stake consensus model.
							This model <strong>consumes far less energy</strong> than the Proof-of Work model.
						</p>

						<p>
							Energy concise considerations were also made when creating this website. Each page is
							generated one time before uploading the files to the server. This allows for database
							& external API calls to be made once every “build” instead of on every page load by
							every user.

						<p>
							Originally, just digital cards were going to be offered. But as we tossed around ideas
							and began showing people early versions of the cards, it became clear that a lot of
							people still wanted something tangible they could hold in their hand. But offering a
							physical product vastly multiplied the complexity of the project. Converting each card
							to a printer-friendly format, finding a printer, figuring out how and if it was
							possible to do all this without cutting down a tree or adding to our planet's urgent
							climate crisis, shipping. All these factors grew this originally small endeavor, to a
							still small, but more time-consuming process.
